# Smeagle Compat

This is a dummy example of using Smeagle for Stability and Compatibility tests,
as outlined in Matt's Binary-Level ABI Compatibility Model.

 - [stability-tests](stability): compares two versions of a library to itself
 - [compatibility-tests](compatibility-tests): compares a binary and contender library 

All data is generated from smeagle's facts in the [artifacts](https://github.com/buildsi/build-abi-containers-results/tree/main/artifacts/smeagle)
repository.
