# Test Cases... in the Wild!

This folder includes test cases or notes that could help to produce them
from in the wild, meaning:

 - Slacks
 - papers
 - listserves
 
In the case of having supplementary files, a folder is included. In the case of
being a large set of notes from a resource, a single markdown file in this folder
is sufficient.
